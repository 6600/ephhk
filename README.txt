A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/mblode/pen/rfDek.

 If you liked my pen, please share the love :)
This is a test created using the Three.JS 3D, WebGL, Javascript library. I am also using Google's Dat GUI to control the different aspects of the cube.

Controls: Use mouse to orbit within the 3D environment
 and use the controls to edit the cube's form.

Please leave a comment for any ideas or projects you would like me to create next!
